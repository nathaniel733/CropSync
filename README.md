Project Overview
The Soil Nutrition Management and Smart Drip Irrigation System is an automated agricultural solution designed to optimize soil nutrition and water usage, promoting sustainable farming practices. This system monitors soil moisture and nutrient levels in real time and automatically controls a drip irrigation setup to ensure crops receive the required water and nutrients at the right time. By providing precise, data-driven irrigation, this project aims to increase crop yield, reduce water and fertilizer wastage, and improve overall soil health.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
Real-Time Soil Monitoring: Continuously tracks soil moisture and nutrient levels using sensors.
Automated Drip Irrigation: Activates irrigation only when necessary based on soil moisture readings, conserving water.
Smart Nutrient Management: Integrates with soil nutrient data to adjust irrigation practices according to soil health needs.
User-Friendly Interface: Displays soil data and system status on a web interface, making it accessible to farmers and agriculturalists.
Low-Cost and Energy Efficient: Built with affordable components and optimized to use minimal power, making it suitable for small farms.
<h3>System Components</h3>
Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures soil moisture levels to determine irrigation needs.
Soil Nutrient Sensor: Detects nutrient content in the soil to aid in nutrition management.
Arduino Microcontroller: Controls the entire system, processes sensor data, and manages the drip irrigation based on conditions.
Relay Module: Controls the water pump for the drip irrigation setup.
Water Pump: Delivers water through drip irrigation lines.
Web Interface : Displays real-time soil conditions and allows for remote monitoring.
<h3>How It Works</h3>
Soil Sensing: Soil moisture and nutrient sensors provide data to the Arduino microcontroller.
Data Processing: Based on predefined threshold values for moisture and nutrients, the system determines whether the soil requires water or nutrients.
Automated Drip Irrigation: If soil moisture falls below the threshold, the relay activates the water pump, starting irrigation. Once adequate moisture is detected, the pump stops automatically.
Data Display: Real-time soil conditions are displayed on a web interface, allowing users to monitor the system remotely and adjust thresholds as needed.
